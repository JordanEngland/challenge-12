# Employee Tracker Database


## Description

In this SQL project, I built a powerful database management system using MySQL and Node.js. With just a few commands, I created an application that handles employee management tasks effortlessly. Using the command line, I can easily view and organize departments, roles, and employees. I can add new entries, update employee roles, and even delete unnecessary data. The application interacts with the MySQL database behind the scenes, executing SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data. With a user-friendly interface and clear prompts, the application streamlines the process of managing employee information. It's a great tool for professionals like me who need to handle employee data efficiently.
